                    <p>a.k.a <em>The celebration food of Sri Lanka</em>. Made mainly from rice and coconut milk, these white, creamy, milky blocks of deliciousness taste like home to many of the island-dwellers.It is so versatile that it can be served as a side dish alongside other Sri Lankan dishes, but the most popular combo is with the spicy Lunu Miris as seen.</p>

                    <p>Sri Lankan rice and curry, the country's national meal, consisting of steaming hot, fluffy rice (samba or kakulu kinds) eaten with a range of side dishes known as curries. Along with the rice, at least three (preferably five) distinct curries are normally served, one of which is usually based on fish or meat and the other two on vegetables.Sambol (a Sri Lankan relish), a gravy or hodda with spices and coconut milk, mallum (chopped leaves with coconut), and fried crispy items like papadams are common accompaniments to rice and curries. This speciality is a traditional home-cooked meal that is a must-have on restaurant menus in Sri Lanka.It is consumed on a daily basis, generally at lunch.</p>

            <h1><b>KOTTU</b></h1>
            <p>The best and most popular Sri Lankan street food, and possibly the world's most popular Sri Lankan food. Wherever you go in Sri Lanka, you will undoubtedly come across a kottu stand (or "koththu kade," as we Sri Lankans call it). If you google a list of must-eat Sri Lankan foods, I'm confident you'll find kottu on it. If you go to a Sri Lankan restaurant anywhere in the world, you'll see this dish on the menu.</p>
            <img src="imageswebp/kottu.webp" alt="kottu">
            <p>It is essentially made up of shredded pieces of Sri Lankan godamba roti, which is similar to a giant sized paratha (an oily fried piece of thin dough) stir fried with an assortment of spices and a variety of other meaty (or vegetarian) ingredients.</p>
            <br>

                    <p>
                        This Sri Lankan meal, known as pol sambol, is one of the easiest to make yet one of the most exquisite bowls of taste that Sri Lanka has given the world.
                        <br>
                        It concentrates on the magnificent coconut, a fruit crucial in Sri Lankan cuisine. Pol salmbol is nothing more than shredded coconut, chili powder or dried chilies, lime juice, red onions, and salt – and every taste is  magic.

                    <p>
                        Hoppers, also known as appa, are a traditional Sri Lankan dish.
                        <br>
                        It starts with a basic pancake batter that's been flavored with coconut milk and a sprinkle of toddy (Sri Lankan palm wine). The hoppers are prepared in small "wok"-style rounded pans, so the dough cooks thick and soft on the bottom and thin and crunchy around the sides.
