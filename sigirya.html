                    <b>A RICH HISTORY</b>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            According to the Culavamsa, an ancient Sri Lankan chronicle, King Kashyapa chose this location for his new capital. He reigned from around 473 to 495 AD. On top, he fashioned a castle with vibrant and colorful murals, and half way up the cliff, he built a massive lion-shaped doorway. This lion is responsible for the location's name. Sinhagiri translates to "lion rock."
                            <br>
                            The region is now designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The palace and the capital it stood in were deserted after Kashyapa died. It was afterwards utilized as a Buddhist monastery until the 14th century, and is currently considered one of the best-preserved examples of ancient urban layout.
                            <br>
                            Jonathan Forbes rediscovered it in 1831 after it had been abandoned. He was a major in the British army. He was riding his horse around the region when he stumbled across the enormous rock, castle, and lion statue!
                            The site soon drew the interest of historians and archaeologists, but substantial excavations did not begin until the 1980s.

                    <b>DESCRIPTION</b>
                    <div class="desc">
                        <p>
                            The castle complex has the ruins of a palace and is encircled by a huge network of walls, gardens, ponds, waterways, lanes, and fountains.
                            <br>
                            The primary entrance is located on the rock's northern side. It was created in the shape of a massive stone lion, the feet of which have remained to this day, but the higher sections of the body have been demolished.
                            <br>
                            During Kasyapa's rule, the western wall of Sigiriya was nearly totally covered by paintings. To this day, eighteen frescoes have remained.
                            The paintings portray naked females and are thought to be portraits of Kasyapa's wives and concubines or priestesses conducting religious ceremonies. Despite the fact that the girls represented in the frescoes are unknown, these rare antique paintings celebrate feminine beauty and have enormous historical value.

                            The Mirror Wall is one of Sigiriya's most notable features. It was once so well polished that the monarch could see his image in it. The Mirror wall is adorned with inscriptions and poems written by Sigiriya tourists.

                    <b>HOW TO GET HERE?</b>
                    <p>
                        If you want to get to Sigiriya, Dambulla is an excellent place to start. The quickest method to get there from Colombo is to rent a vehicle and drive (around 2.5 hours) or take the bus. This process takes roughly 4 hours and costs about £1 GBP. The bus departs from the Colombo Bastian Mawatha Bus Terminal and arrives in Dambulla. It runs every 15 minutes on average.
                        <br>
                        Sigiriya is approximately a 20-minute drive from Dambulla. If you don't want to drive, a cab will be around £4-6 GBP. Also there are guided trips that involve transportation and frequently include other destinations in the vicinity, such as Polonnaruwa.

                        <ol>
                            <li>Wear your most comfortable shoes because there are 1200 stairs to the peak.</li>
                            <li>Be aware that the final set of steps are metal and might become slippery after rain.</li>
                            <li>Because this is a semi-religious location, there are no limits on what you can wear. Shorts and a tee will suffice!</li>
                            <li>Go early in the morning. It is really warm and crowded around noon.</li>
