                        Arugam Bay, also known as 'Arugam Kudah,' is located on Sri Lanka's east coast, around 320 kilometers from Colombo. From Ella or Trincomalee, you may reach Arugam Bay Beach. Arugam Beach is about 2 hours 30 minutes from Ella and 5 hours from Trincomalee. Colombo to Arugam Beach takes about 7 hours via bus or taxi.
    
                        <br>
                        Arugam Bay's lengthy ribbon of beach, partially shaded by coconut palms, is reason enough to visit. Its allure to surfers is clear during the season, but it is simply a great location to relax and rest all year. A active fishing hamlet may be found on the southern side of the beach, with wooden shacks crammed together at the top of the sand for the hard-working employees. Residents congregate here at evening for a conversation and a swim.
                        <br>
                        
                        Arugam Beach is one of the top ten surfing destinations in the world, according to Wikipedia. If surfing isn't your thing, you can unwind with a local yoga class or take a stroll along the gorgeous beaches.
